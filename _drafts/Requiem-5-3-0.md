Hi Requiem enthusiasts,

This release features new armors and weapons as replacement for the assets that were removed prior to the SSE port due to quality and lore concerns. Additionally, it marks the first step at integrating the Creation Club DLCs into Requiem. For the full list of changes, please refer to the [changelog]({{site.github.repository_url}}/blob/main/components/documentation/src/Changelog.md#requiem-530---around-the-fire).

# New armors

Four new light armors are added to the game using assets from the Creation Club and [Chainmail Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27340) by NordWarUA.

* Chainmail
* Dwarven Light
* Orcish Light
* Netch Leather

They each have a unique material bonus and therefore greatly increase the variety of mid-level light armors. The armors can be crafted with the respective material perk, and they are integrated into the world through loot and merchants.

The remaining armors from the Creation Club are used to enhance visual storytelling. All NPCs who used to wear a custom armor in older versions of Requiem and many others who represent a prominent position or faction now boast a unique armor.

[This document]({{site.github.repository_url}}/blob/main/tools/Notes/Creation%20Club.pdf) describes the integration and most related armor tweaks in more detail.

# New weapons

Six new weapon types are added to the game.

* Tanto
* Wakizashi
* Katana
* Dai-Katana
* Shortsword
* Quarterstaff

The Akaviri-style weapons use assets from [Katana Crafting](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5306) by lautasantenni. You can obtain them either through crafting or by finding the unique copy in the world. The weapons have the same stats as the corresponding standard blade. Currently, they primarily exist to provide aesthetic variety and to revive items present in previous Elder Scrolls games. In the future, Akaviri-style weapons may be differentiated from Tamrielic weapons by dedicated boons from certain blessings or similar sources.

The shortswords and quarterstaffs use assets from [Heavy Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6308) by PrivateEye. They can be crafted with the respective material perk, and they are integrated into the world through loot and merchants.
Shortswords have less damage, weight, and stagger than normal swords, but they swing noticeably faster. Enemy marksmen will often carry a shortsword as their melee backup weapon. Shortswords are also interesting to enchanters because they connect more frequently with the target.
Quarterstaffs fulfill the same role as the existing battlestaffs, but unlike battlestaffs they are available in all materials and their models are clearly designed for combat rather than magic. I plan to remove the battlestaffs at some point and use the Dragonborn DLC crafting system (or a similar concept that is not restricted to Solstheim) for enchanted staffs instead. However, I decided to postpone this endeavor and keep the battlestaffs as a minor variant of quarterstaffs for the time-being.

Furthermore, a few more weapons from Heavy Armory are included to complement the world. Most notably, silver weapons are available in all weapon types.
