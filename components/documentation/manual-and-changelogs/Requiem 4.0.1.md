Requiem 4.0.1 - "Threshold" Bugfix Pack #1
==========================================

This small bugfix release fixes two high-priority bugs that were spotted in 4.0.0 and can significantly affect the game balance.

Bugfixes
--------

* The armor rating scaling factor is corrected, each point of armor rating provides 0.1% damage reduction.
* Armor piercing scaling factors are corrected. Each point of armor penetration provides 1% damage reduction bypass for power and ranged attacks. Standard melee attacks have half as much armor penetration.
* The perk description for Advanced Blacksmithing is updated and no longer mentions crafting exotic blades.
* "Craftsmanship" is spelled correctly in the perk "Arcane Craftsmanship" and the smithing tomes for Elven and Daedric materials.
