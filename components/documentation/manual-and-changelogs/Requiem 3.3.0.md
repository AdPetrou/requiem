Requiem 3.3.0 - "The Quantum Enigma"
====================================

The Reqtificator has been repackaged into a self-contained application. You thus no longer need to install any Java version on your system. Some endgame enemies that were reported as too weak in recent versions have been made tougher.

New Features
------------

* Nordic armor and shield from the Dragonborn DLC is integrated into the world. Bandits sometimes wear parts of the armor. Blacksmiths have a chance to sell the armor and it can be crafted with the Advanced Blacksmithing perk.

Tweaks
------

* Dragons, Dragon Priests, Dwarven Centurions and Enchanted Spheres have increased protection.
* Health of Forgemaster is doubled and damage, mass and illusion resistance is increased to match Dwarven Centurions.
* The Spellbreaking enchantment is applied with each hit and active magic effects are correctly dispelled from the target.
* Spawn chances of heavy armor sold by blacksmiths are adjusted to be more consistent.

Bugfixes
--------

* Poisons from Chaurus, Frostbite Spider and Spriggan are affected by Cure Posion.
* Summons no longer flee from dragons.
* Kvenel the Tongue no longer drops an overpowered version of Ancient Nord Armor.

Installation
------------

* The Reqtificator ships as a self-contained application. You thus no longer need to install any system-wide Java runtime to set up Requiem. Instead, the Reqtificator ships with its own, stripped down JVM version as part of the Requiem download.
