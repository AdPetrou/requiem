Requiem 5.1.0 - "From Past to Present"
======================================

Extra armor rating against slash, blunt, and pierce attacks is removed. In its place high-quality armor materials provide unique bonuses. Stats and presentation of armors are tweaked to support and complement these changes.

New Features
------------

* Extra armor rating against slash, blunt, and pierce attacks is removed. In its place high-quality armor materials provide unique bonuses. The first Evasion or Heavy Armor perk is required to unlock the bonuses. Each piece of armor grants the following effect, stacking additively up to four times. Shields do not count towards the four items. You can check your current armor material bonus in your active magic effects screen.
    * Aetherium: 8% less damage from blunt weapons.
    * Ancient Falmer: +4% magic resistance.
    * Chitin: 6% less damage from ranged weapons.
    * Daedric: +6% magic resistance.
    * Dawnguard Heavy: 21% less damage from vampiric drain.
    * Dawnguard Light: 14% less damage from vampiric drain.
    * Dragonplate: 9% less damage from the voice, immunity to Unrelenting Force at four pieces.
    * Dragonscale: 6% less damage from the voice, immunity to Unrelenting Force at four pieces.
    * Dwarven: 5% less damage from blunt weapons.
    * Ebony: +6% fire resistance.
    * Elven: Spells are 2% more effective.
    * Falmer: 5% less damage from ranged weapons.
    * Glass: +4% fire resistance.
    * Imperial Legate: Nearby Imperial soldiers deal +4% damage.
    * Nordic Carved: Spells are 3% more effective.
    * Orcish: Power attacks cost 6% less stamina.
    * Stalhrim Heavy: +6% frost resistance.
    * Stalhrim Light: +4% frost resistance.
    * Steel Plate: 8% less damage from slashing weapons.
    * Stormcloak Officer: Nearby Stormcloak soldiers deal+4% damage.
* Each rank of ranged protection provided by armors grants 50 armor rating (was 60). The ranks are no longer listed in the active magic effects screen. To this end, the ranks are reassigned as follows to provide a more intuitive progression:
    * Rank 1 are low-level light armors: Alik'r, Blackguard, Forsworn, Fur, Guard, Hide, Imperial light, Leather, Linwe's, Shrouded, Skaal, Stormcloak, Thieves Guild, and Vampire armor.
    * Rank 2 are mid-level light armors: Chitin, Dawnguard Light, Elven, Falmer, Morag Tong, Reinforced Chitin, Penitus Oculatus, and Scaled armor.
    * Rank 3 are high-level light armors: Ancient Falmer, Dragonscale, Glass, and Stalhrim Light armor.
    * Rank 4 are faction leader light armors: Ancient Shrouded, General Tullius', Nightingale, Thieves Guild Master, Ulfric's, and Vampire Royal armor.
    * Rank 5 are all heavy armors.
* Integration of the armors from the Dragonborn DLC into the mainland continues:
    * Bonemold armor has the same armor rating as steel armor but the same weight as iron armor. It can be bought from Brand-Shei and Revyn Sadri. Tempering requires the Craftsmanship perk.
    * Skaal armor has the same stats as leather armor. It can be bought from Birna. Tempering requires the Craftsmanship perk.
    * Stalhrim armor has the same stats as ebony and glass armor. Tempering requires Ebony smithing and obtaining the necessary knowledge in Solstheim.
    * Two sets of stalhrim armor are found in draugr crypts where an associated quest suggests the presence of a treasure.
    * Enchanted stalhrim armor is sometimes found in draugr boss chests with the Treasure Hunter perk.
* Perk descriptions of Block, Evasion, and Heavy Armor expose the gameplay effects. They use the following convention to denote how percentages stack. This is extended to Marksmanship, One-Handed, and Two-Handed perks too.
    * "X% less/more" means this effect stacks multiplicatively with other effects.
    * "+X% less/more" means this effect stacks additively with identical effects and is then applied as a multiplicative effect.
* Imperial Legates have a unique armor. Legate Rikke wears an enchanted set. Already spawned NPCs may continue using their old outfit.

Tweaks
------

* Armor rating of many mid and high-level armors is increased by 100 to counterbalance the loss of additional damage protections.
* Imperial, Stormcloak, and guard armors have +12/30/9/9/15 AR (head/body/hands/feet/shield) when worn by a faction member (including the player) ~to counterbalance the loss of additional damage protections~ because the officers have been drilling the new recruits.
* Hidden damage reduction is removed from Evasion perks.
* Weight of several light armors is increased to provide a more logical progression and account for the new material bonuses.
    * Chitin: +10
    * Dawnguard: +15
    * Dragonscale: +10
    * Glass: +25
    * Scaled: +5
* Slight armor rating and weight adjustments to have a more unified ruleset.

    * Armor rating of light armor is always a multiple of 50.
    * Armor weight of heavy armors is always a multiple of 10.
    * Armor rating is rounded in favor of boots and at the expense of gauntlets because as a result of the above changes the armor rating of a helmet, cuirass, or shield is always an integer.

* Price of Wolf armor is increased to 5000.
* Weight of glass weapons is increased by 2.

Bugfixes

Internal Quality Improvements (only relevant for modders)
---------------------------------------------------------

* `000AD241 <ArmorImperialHeavyOutfitOfficer>` is exclusively used by Legate Rikke because during A Jagged Crown she is scripted to change into this outfit.
* General Tullius' Armor and Vampire Royal Armor have resistance keywords assigned in the plugin.
* Ancient Falmer armor is refered to as such in `ArmorKeywordAssignments_Requiem.esp.conf`.
