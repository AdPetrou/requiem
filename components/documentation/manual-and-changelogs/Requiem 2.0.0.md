Requiem 2.0.0 - "The Phantom Agony"
===================================

Our favourite overhaul has been overhauled! With USKP ousted we're now only usable with USLEEP, so dependent on all DLCs (though with Dragonborn disabled). With awesome archery, ferocious fighting, luscious lockpicking, hearthfire happiness, sumptuous snacks, lighter looting, banished bugs, gripping games, and one curious quest.

Highlights
----------

**Awesome Archery:** The Marksman perk tree has been rearranged and archery bugs have been fixed. The Ranger perk (previously Fast Movement) only works with light bows and crossbows... but it only takes a little skill to acquire, and sneaking no longer breaks it. Heavy bow and crossbow users will find their weapons less draining. Even novices can send arrows winging their way over a distance, unless you're trying to be sneaky. Different parts of armor provide different arrow protection, with a simple keyword-based approach that modders can easily follow. Boots and gauntlets will no longer protect your innards! Perks can help you to overcome such arrow protection and skilled marksman might even find some weakspots in the armor plating of automatons. And silver arrows, advanced bolts and explosive bolts have all been given a make-over and are now distinct and beautiful.

**Ferocious Fighting:** Evasion perks grant a reduction to physical damage and an increase in evasion xp gain... but only if you wear no heavy armor. Bashing perks work with both shields and weapon bashes. Fortify armor still further with enchantments. But it's not all in your favour: effects which were formerly the exclusive privilege of players are now distributed to NPCs, who can use daedric weapons, warhammers and maces to pierce armor just as you do, and some bosses are even more dangerous... even when newly risen from their sarcophagi.

**Luscious Lockpicking:** With a more gradual difficulty curve, various chests are no longer out of your reach until you suddenly find inspiration. While some chests may still defy your talents, others will require true dexterity, and several lockpicks. Friends and hirelings are restricted by their own skills... and their morals. Lockpicking bonuses from different sources such as potions and enchantments can be combined and some unique items and effects will also help you to coax open more challenging locks. Mages no longer have to deal with quicksilver ore if they want to use arcane arts to unlock a lock, but the new "Knock" spells have their own twists...

**Hearthfire Happiness:** Hearthfire is now fully integrated. The three Hearthfire houses are available at low levels... though you still have to do some favours for the Jarls first. They'll grant you enough material to build a bed for the night, after which you might have to do some searching; stone and clay of suitable quality can be hard to find! And building the houses will actually take time...

**Sumptuous Snacks:** The cuisine of Skyrim has been refined for the most discerning palate. Stews remain stupendous, alcohol amazing, Hearthfire's ovens are outstanding and getting drunk is just delightful. Strong Nords won't be double-counting dragons after only a single ale, and a gulp of good booze might give you a useful edge. But beware; too much alcohol might have unexpected interactions with your breakfast stew!

**Lighter Looting:** Gold can weigh down the body as well as the soul. Gems and jewellery are more commonly found and often more valuable, and more merchants are willing to buy them for a fair price. Armor is easier to carry when you wear it, and arrows weigh much less than they did.

**Banished Bugs:** From horses that sound like catapults to mountain flower trickery, from misbehaving rune spells to overpowered vegetables, a multitude of bugs and unbalancing tweaks including those reported have been fixed.

**Gripping Games:** The language and wording of Requiem-specific messages and descriptions has been reworked for easier, more immersive reading, from the Reqtificator to initialization, to picking your character and playing the game. Mage difficulty tags are reverted to vanilla for consistency, summon spell names have also been made consistent and more immersive, and vampires will no longer drop dead immediately just for touching shiny things. With a meaner, leaner MCM, updated descriptions that you can actually read, and several other requested changes included, Requiem games will be smoother and more believable than ever before.

**A Curious Quest:** While adventuring you find a strange piece of paper. It looks like a fragment of something eerily familiar, but where are the other pieces? Help the Bard's College reassemble the lost work... and find out what really happened on Hogithum.

**Legendarily Lazy:** We no longer support USKP, and as such require all DLCs. Note that Dragonborn is disabled; the quest will not run and no radiant quests will send you to Solstheim without a suitable patch.
