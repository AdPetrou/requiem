Requiem 2.0.2 - "The Phantom Agony" Bugfix Pack #2
==================================================

Crucial changes to cumbersome coins and contracts, cloying construction, clandestine cups and other complications!

Other Tweaks
------------

* The FOMOD installer now allows you to select an optional plugin which will re-enable access to the unreqtified Dragonborn DLC. This plugin simply re-enables the cultist attack, the travel to Solstheim dialogue, the Ebony Warrior encounter and some crafting recipes from the Dragonborn DLC. 
* A large part of the reward for bounty quests is now paid in gems. Contracts on giants also pay more than they used to. Various other quests that used to give large amounts of gold as reward have a large share of their reward paid out in gems, including "Hail Sithis!", "Tending the Flames", "Aftershock", "Rise in the East" and "The Wolf Queen Awakened".
* You can now see and hear NPCs when they drink alcohol. (Bandits like to use the fortify health effect from alcohol as a health potion substitute which seemed like sudden unjustified health regeneration before.)
* The outdated Vanilla Shrines option is removed from the FOMOD installer. If you have used this option in the past you might want to use [Requiem - Blessings Ignore Crimes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50251) instead.
* Talos' greater blessing now gives 15% bonus to melee damage instead of adding a flat 20 points.
* Blacksmiths and fletchers have more common bolts for sale. Fletchers and caravaneers also have limited stocks of explosive ammunition in store. 
* You will be notified when you try to open a lock which qualifies as challenging with your current lockpicking expertise level. This also allows you to delegate the task to your follower if they have the necessary skills. 
* Tiny spiders no longer paralyze or use spit attacks. 
* The lunge attack of large and giant spiders paralyzes instead of knocking down. 
* Updated to USLEEP 3.0.13a. 
* The quest components for "On Hogithum" have been moved to more obvious places to make it easier to start and complete the quest. 
* The yield of stone quarries is doubled to 32 and each Hearthfire house has at least three stone quarries in close proximity. General merchants in major cities sell clay and quarried stone. 

Bugfixes
--------

* The quest "The Whispering Door" now proceeds normally after you acquired the key. (If you already opened the door and picked up the item behind it, the update will progress the quest to the correct state to recover from the bug.)
* The system penalizing excessive use of wait and sleep with reduced regeneration rates has been retracted. It turned out that this feature causes incompatibilities with other mods which let time progress, like Time Flies.
* The technical aspects of the new lockpicking system have been reworked. You can no longer be locked into an NPC's house. You will be notified if a lock is considered challenging for you. Compatibility with mods that use scripted activation-blocks has also been improved.
* The potency of self-made lockpicking enchantments now scales properly with your enchanting perks.
* Followers need the correct lockpicking expertise to pick master level locks.
* Evasion training works as intended.
* Isran once again trains heavy armor instead of evasion.
* All racial skill rate bonuses are also applied to their vampire variants.
* Transforming into a vampire lord while having Dawnbreaker or the beacon doesn't save your damned existence from Meridia's Malediction.
* The Oghma Infinium cannot be read multiple times in quick succession to get the reward more than once.
* Daedra Banishing spells, staffs and scrolls do not scare atronachs permanently if the banishment fails.
* A light armored version of the Ancient Nord Armor which had very high armor rating can no longer be obtained by the player. Any armor pieces in the player's inventory will be removed.
* Stamina buffs from Ring of Namira no longer stack.
* The Indomitable Force perk no longer affects self-targeted shouts.
* Jyrik Gauldurson is no longer immediately aggressive during "Forbidden Legend".
* Legendary Elven Shield has block and bash data of a light shield.
* The master locked chest in Yngvild can be opened with the key that is looted from the boss.
* The LItemArmorHelmetLightBest leveled list contains Imperial Light Helmet instead of Imperial Helmet.
* Gorak the Trollslayer is immune to paralysis.
* A special Giant Slaughterfish ignores 75% of armor like all other Giant Slaughterfishes.
* Small and big variants of the sabre cats can respawn.
* Hitting Alduin with a warhammer makes a sound.
* Deleveled some items from "Missing in Action" that were still leveled.
* Fixed various flags on notes and books added by Requiem.
* The USLEEP-added cooked boar meat recipe is disabled.
* Fixed an incorrect spawn chance for an expert alteration tomes leveled item.
* Savos Aren should no longer show up naked.
