Requiem 5.2.2 - "The Gathering Storm" Bugfix Pack #2
====================================================

A small bugfix release to fix a high-priority bug that was spotted in 5.2.0 and can significantly affect the game balance.

Bugfixes
--------

* Armor weight penalty reduction from perks does not reduce damage taken.
* Updated to Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch v4.2.7. Earlier versions of the Unofficial Patch should remain compatible and the free Creation Club DLCs were not added as a dependency to `Requiem.esp`.
