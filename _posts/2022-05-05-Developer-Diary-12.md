Hi guys and gals,

Ogerboss here. I have made the decision to end my engagement in Requiem. I make this decision with a heavy heart, but it’s the best for both the mod and myself.

My contributions to the project have been irregular since I accepted the role of a technical lead in my professional career. Originally, I assumed this would be a temporary learning curve effect and then settle back into a regular rhythm. I have now been offered the role of architect for the product my team is working on. In this new position I will be coordinating the work of two dozen engineers from a very diverse tech stack, ranging from sensor firmware over edge software and data science all the way to cloud backends and frontends. After being slowly prepared for this new role during the last quarter, April has been my trial by fire for this new position. Thriving in this new role and delivering the level of excellence that I expect from myself will require all my creative energy. However, a hobby project the size of Requiem also deserves a significant amount of creative energy and time commitment. This very intense, challenging and fun month has made it clear to me that this combination of work and Requiem will not be sustainable for me. I have therefore made the decision to leave the Requiem Dungeon Masters to focus on this exciting opportunity in my career.

Requiem’s development will continue under thetrader’s leadership. He will communicate more details about this release and his strong vision for Requiem’s future in a few days. Requiem 5.0.3 will be released on Sunday and you can expect 5.1.0 in about 1-2 weeks.

I want to use this opportunity to sincerely thank all my fellow Requiem Dungeon Masters, both past and present, for their contributions to this project and the amazing journey we had over the years. I learned so many things while working with Xarrian, thetrader, Axonis, Heckur and Ludovician on this project. I also want to thank the Requiem community for all the support along the way. Interacting with all of you was a very fun experience and contributed significantly to my personal and professional growth. I will never forget the days after the release of the first Reqtificator version when all hell broke loose and I had to write \~500 posts a day on Nexus to keep the fires under control.

How many of you remember this?

Sovngarde awaits!
