Hi guys and gals,

A few days ago, just before the end of 2021, we finally published Requiem 5.0.0 for Skyrim Special Edition 1.6.x. (Some people call this “Anniversary Edition” but we avoid the term to not cause any confusion that Requiem might require the paid DLC that was released together with this free update.) Since then we got a lot of positive reactions, including a multitude of cheerful comments, more than 1k downloads within the last 30 hours of 2021, being catapulted into the Hot Files section on Nexus and currently ranking second place for the mod of the month.

Overall, the rollout of Requiem 5.0.0 went quite smooth so far. However, we did see a few annoyances in the new Reqtificator which we want to address quickly to make the installation process easier. Therefore, we release a small bugfix pack today, Requiem 5.0.1. The two key improvements in this release are:

* The “cannot locate game folder” issue has been fixed.
* The Reqtificator provides better error messages that include the FormID of the record it was patching when an error occurred and the last overwrite for that record.

The second improvement will help you to find issues in your load order faster and help us to determine whether any problems you encounter are actual bugs in the rewritten Reqtificator or inconsistencies in the plugins you want to patch. Please continue to report any bugs and issues you encounter at our Service Desk, this feedback is extremely valuable for us.
