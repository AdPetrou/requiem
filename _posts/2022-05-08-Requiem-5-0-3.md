Hi Requiem enthusiasts,

As announced in [Sovngarde Awaits]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-05-05-Developer-Diary-12 %}), Ogerboss has made the decision to end his engagement in Requiem. This is the last release in which he took part before his journey to Sovngarde. It addresses more common installation problems, improves compatibility with some mods, and fixes two important bugs.

* In the previous release we disabled the innate running speed penalty in favor of the Mass Effect. However, it turns out the way in which we disabled the penalty caused a division by zero in an internal calculation. While this didn’t pose a problem for the penalty, it caused the camera to spin around very quickly when using the mod True Directional Movement. According to a user report it also interferes with the behavior of followers and it’s likely responsible for other unexpected behavior. After realizing that the innate running speed penalty uses almost the same formula as the equivalent Oblivion feature, we were able to disable it while avoiding the division by zero.
* [The terrible secret of the Examine power is no more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjA5TEJfxEw).

More changes can be found in the [changelog]({{site.github.repository_url}}/blob/main/components/documentation/src/Changelog.md#requiem-503---from-the-ashes-bugfix-pack-3) as usual.

# What’s next?

Alongside this release I’m sharing my vision for Requiem’s future in [Roadmap to Requiem 6.0.0]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-05-12-Developer-Diary-14 %}).
